# DRrank

DRrank is a Python library to implement the Empirical Bayes ranking scheme developed in [Kline, Rose, and Walters (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13005). This code was originally developed by [Hadar Avivi](https://avivihadar.github.io/).

After having successfully set up Gurobipy, install  **DRrank** via pip:

```bash
pip install drrank
```

## Usage

### 1. Load sample data

**DRrank** grades units based on noisy estimates of a latent attribute. You can construct these estimates however you'd like---all **DRrank** requires is a vector of estimates, $\hat{\theta}_i$, and their associated standard errors, $s_i$.

To illustrate the package's features, this readme uses the data in *example/name_example.csv*, which contains estimates of name-specific contact rates from the experiment studied in Kline, Rose, and Walters (2023). These contact rates have been adjusted to stabilize their variances using the Bartlett (1936) transformation. Variance-stabilization is useful because the deconvolution procedure used in Step 2 below requires that $s_i$ be independent of $\theta_i$. In cases where variance stabilization is not possible, independence can sometimes be restored by residualizing $\hat{\theta_i}$ against $s_i$; see Section 5 of [Kline, Rose, and Walters (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13005) for a detailed example. The transformation used in our names example computes estimates as $\hat{\theta}_i = sin^{-1} \sqrt{\hat{p}_i}$, where $\hat{p}_i$ is share of applications with name $i$ that received a callback. As discussed in the paper, $\hat{\theta}_i$ has asymptotic variance of $(4N_i)^{-1}$, where $N_i$ is the number of applications sent with name $i$.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read in the data
data = pd.read_csv(os.getcwd() + '/example/name_example.csv')
data.head()
```

|   name_id |   thetas |         s | firstname   |
|----------:|---------:|----------:|:------------|
|         1 | 0.53788  | 0.0137214 | Adam        |
|         2 | 0.518394 | 0.0173332 | Aisha       |
|         3 | 0.53767  | 0.0174933 | Allison     |
|         4 | 0.532129 | 0.0138126 | Amanda      |
|         5 | 0.534998 | 0.0136503 | Amy         |


While **DRrank** provides the functionality to account for any variance-stabilizing transformation, using one is not strictly necessary. **DRrank** can also accomodate cases where the $\hat{\theta}_i$ directly capture untransformed estimates of the relevant latent attribute.

### 2. Estimating the prior

 **DRrank** provides the functionality to estimate a prior distribution using a variation on Efron (2016)'s [log-spline deconvolution](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/103/1/1/2390141?redirectedFrom=fulltext) approach, which uses an exponential family mixing distribution with density parameterized by a flexible B-th order natural  cubic spline. 

To estimate the prior, generate an instance of the `prior_estimate` class with each unit's estimated latent attribute, $\hat{\theta}_i$, and its associated standard errors. You also have the option of supplying an inverse transform in case the $\hat{\theta}_i$ have been transformed to stabilize variances. The appropriate inverse transform for the ranking name-specific contact rates in Kline, Rose, and Walters (2023), for example, is $f(x) = sin(x)^2$. The inverse transform function should be vectorized.

```python
from drrank_distribution import prior_estimate
thetas = data.thetas.values # set of estimates
s = data.s.values # setstandard errors

# Initialize the estimator
G = prior_estimate(thetas, s, transform=lambda x: np.power(np.sin(x),2))

# Estimate the prior distribution 
G.estimate_prior(supp_points=5000, spline_order=5, seed = 123)
```

Use the `supp_points` option (default=5000) to pick the number of points of support over which to evaluate the prior density. The minimum and maximum of the support are the minimum and maximum of `thetas`. 

Use the `spline_order` option (default=5) to adjust the degrees of freedom of the spline that parameterizes the mixing distribution.

The estimated prior distribution will be saved as a dictionary. You can access it with the following code:

```python

# Dictionary with the prior distribution
G.prior_g

# Keys:
# mean_theta: mean of the prior
G.prior_g['mean_theta']
# sd_theta: standard deviation of the prior
G.prior_g['sd_theta']
# g_theta: estimated prior density
G.prior_g['g_theta']
```

You can then graph the results by calling the following function:

```python

# Plot the estimated prior distribution
G.plot_estimates(save_path = "example/prior_distribution.jpg")
```

![prior_distribution](https://github.com/ekrose/drrank/blob/estimate_pis/example/prior_distribution.jpg?raw=true)

Within the function you can specify the following arguments:
- *g_theta*: provide your own prior distribution G. `None` implies the function will utilize the estimated G from the *estimate_prior()* method (default = `None`).
- *show_plot*: whether to show the plot or not (default = `True`).
- *save_path*: path to where the plot will be saved. `None` implies the graph will not be saved (default = `None`).

### 3. Estimation of posterior features and $P$ matrix

Once the prior distribution has been estimated, you can estimate posterior means and credible intervals, as well as the matrix of pairwise posterior ordering probabilities $P$.

```python
# Compute the posterior features
G.compute_posteriors(alpha=.05, g_theta=None)
G.pmean # posterior means
G.pmean_trans # inverse transformed posterior means
G.lci # lower limit of 1-alpha credible interval
G.uci # upper limit of 1-alpha credible interval
G.lci_trans # lower limit of inverse transformed 1-alpha credible interval
G.uci_trans # upper limit of inverse transformed 1-alpha credible interval

G.posterior_df.head() # Dataframe of posterior features
```

|    |    pmean |   pmean_trans |      lci |      uci |   lci_trans |    uci_trans|
|---:|---------:|--------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|------------:|
|  0 | 0.522524 |      0.249088 | 0.50771  | 0.532169 |    0.236368 |    0.257458 |
|  1 | 0.515032 |      0.242678 | 0.493166 | 0.529646 |    0.224124 |    0.255255 |
|  2 | 0.52051  |      0.247361 | 0.497425 | 0.531542 |    0.227686 |    0.25691  |
|  3 | 0.521265 |      0.248005 | 0.500928 | 0.531446 |    0.23063  |    0.256826 |
|  4 | 0.521993 |      0.248631 | 0.50456  | 0.531815 |    0.233697 |    0.257149 |

Then compute the pairwise ordering probabilities $P$ using:

```python
# Compute the pairwise ordering probabilities
pis = G.compute_pis(g_theta=None, ncores=-1, power=0)
```

In both functions, it is possible to provide your own prior distribution G by feeding an array as the `g_theta` argument. This density must take support on the values determined by `G.supp_theta`.

`compute_pis` also provides the option to compute the elements of $P$, $\pi_{ij}$, as the posterior expectation of $max(\theta_i - \theta_j,0)^{power}$, providing an extension to weighted ranking exercises. The default, $power=0$, will produce $\pi_{ij}$ that are posterior ordering probabilities discussed in the next section and implies that ranking mistakes a considered equally costly regardless of the cardinal difference between $\theta_i$ and $\theta_j$.

### 4. Computing grades

To compute rankings, use the **fit** function with a matrix $P$. In the unweighted case, $P$ reflects the posterior probabilities that observation i's latent measure $\theta_i$ exceeds unit j's. That is, each element of this matrix takes the form:


$\pi_{ij} = Pr(\theta_i > \theta_j | Y_i = y_i, Y_j = y_j)$

**DRrank** expects these probabilities to satisfy $\pi_{ij} = 1-\pi_{ji}$ and will report a warning if that does not appear to be the case.

In the weighted case, $P$ captures expected differences between i and j's value of $\theta$, as discussed above. 

There are two ways to use **DRrank**.

First, one can supply a parameter $\lambda \in [0,1]$, which corresponds to the user's value of correctly ranking pairs of units relative to the costs of misclassifying them. $\lambda=1$ implies correct and incorrect rankings are valued equally, while $\lambda=0$ implies correct rankings are not valued at all. In the unweighted case, it is optimal to assign unit $i$ a higher grade than unit $j$ when $\pi_{ij} > 1/(1+\lambda)$, which implies $\lambda$ also determines the minimum level of posterior certainty required to rank units pairwise.

```python
from drrank import fit
from simul_pij import simul_data

# Fit the report card function
results = fit(pis, lamb = 0.25, DR = None)
```

The results object contains the row index of $P$, the assigned grades, and the Condorcet rank (i.e., grade under $\lambda=1$). 

|   obs_idx |   grades_lamb0.25 |   condorcet_rank |
|----------:|------------------:|-----------------:|
|         1 |                 1 |                3 |
|         2 |                 1 |               32 |
|         3 |                 1 |               12 |
|         4 |                 1 |                9 |
|         5 |                 1 |                5 |

We also provide functionality to compute results for a list of values of $\lambda$ in parallel:

```python
import numpy as np
from drrank import fit_multiple

# Try different values of Lambda
results_l = fit_multiple(p_ij, np.arange(0, 0.9, 0.01))
```

Second, one can ask **DRrank** to compute grades that maximize Kendall (1938)'s $\tau$, a measure of the rank correlation between units' latent rankings and assigned grades, subject to a constraint on the expected share of pairwise units incorrectly classified, which we refer to as the Discordance Rate (DR).

```python

# Fit the report card function
results_dr = fit(p_ij, lamb = None, DR = 0.05)
```

Finally, we provide functionality to plot grades along with posterior means and credible intervals:

```python
from drrank import fig_ranks

# Merge the results with the identity of our observations
results['firstname'] = data.firstname
fig_ranks(ranking = results, posterior_features = G.posterior_df, ylabels = 'firstname', save_path = 'example/name_ranking.jpg')
```

![name_ranking](https://github.com/ekrose/drrank/blob/estimate_pis/example/name_ranking.jpg?raw=true)

Within the function you can specify the following arguments:
- *results*: ranking results from *drrank.fit*
- *posterior_features*: posterior features computed through *G.compute_posteriors()*
- *ylabels*: optional, specify the column in *results* where we have stored the labels of each observation (default = `None`)
- *show_plot*: whether to show the plot or not (default = `True`)
- *save_path*: path to where the plot will be saved; `None` implies the graph will not be saved (default = `None`)
